#  Oculus Troubleshooter &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; ![alt text](https://github.com/OceanOC/Quest-Troubleshooter/blob/main/icon.ico "Icon")

Makes finding Oculus files easy and allows to change some settings

This is the C# and the future version that will be updated, this will eventually be pushed to main

## Why do I need this?

if you want to change settings from the debug tool you'd have to go through tons of files to open it instead you'd just have to press 2 buttons with this program
